            The goal of the assessment is to identify your risk for chronic
            illness and determine if there are some things you and your doctor
            can do to stop the disease before it starts! This is a proactive
            approach for your health!

            <u>What does pre-diabetes mean?</u> Prediabetes means you have a
            higher than normal blood sugar level. It's not high enough to be
            considered type 2 diabetes yet, but with some simple changes, adults
            and children with prediabetes can prevent type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <u
            >Key Findings from the 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Report
            include:</u
          >
          <ul>
            <li>34.2 million Americans—just over 1 in 10—have diabetes.</li>
            <li>
              88 million American adults—approximately 1 in 3—have prediabetes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <u>What does diabetes do to your body?</u><br />
          High Blood sugar damages your body silently for many years before you
          “feel” symptoms.<br />
          High Blood sugar damages nerves, blood vessels, and kidneys.<br />
          Diabetes is the major cause of blindness, kidney failure and
          neuropathy (constant pain, numbness, tingling and burning sensation in
          hands and feet), as well as pain and suffering related to poor
          health.<br />

          <p>
            You are at an increased risk for Type 2 Diabetes. There is no need
            to be alarmed. Right now, it doesn't appear that you have Diabetes
            so that means there are plenty of small steps you can take to
            reverse this. Your provider will talk to you today about the
            options.
